# Password Security Simulation

**Overview**

This project simulates password cracking to demonstrate the impact of password complexity on security. It uses a brute-force approach to crack passwords of varying complexity and measures the time taken to crack each password.

## Features

- Simulates password cracking using brute-force method
- Tests passwords with different complexity levels
- Measures and displays the time taken to crack each password
- Visualizes the results using a bar chart

## Password Complexity Levels

- **Simple**: `abc`
- **Moderate**: `aB3`
- **Complex**: `aB3!`
- **Very Complex**: `aB3!xY7@`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:Pradyum-1712/password_security_simulation.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd password_security_simulation
```
3. Ensure you have Python installed. You can install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

**Usage**

1. Run the script:
```bash
python password_cracker.py
```

2. The script will simulate the password cracking and display the time taken for each password complexity level. A bar chart will also be generated to visualize the results.

### **Adding the README to Your Repository**

1. **Create the README file**:
   - Open Terminal and navigate to your project directory:

     ```bash
     cd ~/Desktop/password_security_simulation
     ```

   - Create a new file named `README.md`:

     ```bash
     nano README.md
     ```

   - Copy and paste the README content above into the file. Save and exit (in `nano`, use `Ctrl+O`, `Enter`, `Ctrl+X`).

2. **Add and commit the README file**:
